Schematic illustration of the NeXt4ACP framework. (A) Overview of the NeXt4ACP architecture, which comprises four main components: feature extraction, initial prediction using machine learning classifiers, feature refinement via a multi-layer grouped residual network, and final classification. (B) Representation of the first module, predictions generated by four distinct machine learning classifiers (RF, XGBoost, LightGBM, and HistGridientBoosting). (C) Structure of ResNeXt module, consisting of five sequential layers with multiple residual blocks, followed by the terminal classification layer.
